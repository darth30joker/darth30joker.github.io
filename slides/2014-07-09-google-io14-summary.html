# What is Google I/O?

Google I/O is an annual software developer-focused conference held by Google in San Francisco, California.

Google I/O features highly technical, in-depth sessions focused on building web, mobile, and enterprise applications with Google and open web technologies such as Android, Chrome, Chrome OS, Google APIs, Google Web Toolkit, App Engine, and more.

Google I/O was started in 2008. The .red[I] and .red[O] stand for input/output, and "Innovation in the Open".

# Dataflow VS MapReduce

* deprecated MapReduce years ago
* still in beta

---

# disadvantages of MapReduce

* hard to retreive data
* parsing has nothing to do with pipepline
* need a cluster to run MR

---

# advantags of Dataflow

* can deal with arge mount of data
* faster than MR
* use pipeline
* easy to use based on Google Cloud Platform
* [http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2014/06/sneak-peek-google-cloud-dataflow-a-cloud-native-data-processing-service.html](http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2014/06/sneak-peek-google-cloud-dataflow-a-cloud-native-data-processing-service.html)

# Solve for X

* https://www.solveforx.com/about/

# Solve for X

Solve For X is a place to hear about and discuss radical technology ideas for solving global problems. Radical in the sense that the solutions could help millions or billions of people. Radical in the sense that the audacity of the proposals makes them sound like science fiction. And radical in the sense that there is some real technology breakthrough on the horizon indicating that these ideas could really be brought to life.

---

# Solve for X

Solve For X is intended to be a forum to encourage and amplify technology-based moonshot thinking and teamwork. The forum began in 2012 with a small face-to-face event co-created and co-hosted by Astro Teller, Megan Smith, and Eric Schmidt. Watch videos of talks from that event here.

# Trends

* JavaScript, maybe Dart
* Go
* Dataflow
