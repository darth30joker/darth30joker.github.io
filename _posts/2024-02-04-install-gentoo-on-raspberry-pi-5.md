title: Install Gentoo on Raspberry Pi 5

Installing Gentoo on Raspberry Pi can be easy, can be hard. There are pre-built images like [GenPi64](https://github.com/GenPi64/gentoo-on-rpi-64bit), but this is not under development anymore.

Another way to install Gentoo is to download the stage 3 file and install it like installing on normal PCs, except we need to download firmwares from official repositories.

I have written a wiki page to demonstrate how to install Gentoo on a raspberry pi 5, and it only takes 30 minutes.

For more details, you can always go to [Raspberry Pi Install Guide](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_Install_Guide), which is a new page contains installation guides for all raspberry pi versions.
